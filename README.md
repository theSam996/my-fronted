### About the Project
### ðŸ“˜ About the Project

**Edify** is designed to simplify and digitize college timetable management for academic institutions.  
It offers an easy-to-implement solution, even for colleges with limited digital infrastructure, by supporting simple `.csv` integrations through the SIS model.

Using an optimization engine such as **Google OR-Tools**, Edify will generate distinct, functional, and error-free timetables â€” complete with smart adjustment and flexibility options.
